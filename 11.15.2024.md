  - There's someone probably willing to fund you for that thing.
- On competing with AI:
  - The human aspect. E.g. you watch a HUMAN play chess with another HUMAN
  - Human CHO. When the AI requires the above ^ they will get this human to do the thing.

Actions:
- Reflect on what I want... after freedom.
- Create github with an update
- Get 10 strangers to follow me on instagram
- What is truth?

# Get 10 strangers to follow me on instagram

On Monday, during lunch. I will cold approach people and ask them : "Yo, i'm doing this challenge where I get 10 random people to follow me, could you help me out?"

Updating back once I have results.

# What is truth?

Truth is something I know is 100% true.

I assume the reason we ask this question is because: False beliefs can lead to even more false beliefs.

Truth is the foundation.

# What is my system for figuring out the truth?

Keep asking why until I cannot go further, until I get to the 1st principles. 

At the same time, also noticing the potential fears that may  be holding me back. That way I can act on the information. E.g. social norms.
