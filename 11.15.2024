Notes:
- When you accomplish your freedom. Then what?
  - There's someone probably willing to fund you for that thing.
- On competing with AI:
  - The human aspect. E.g. you watch a HUMAN play chess with another HUMAN
  - Human CHO. When the AI requires the above ^ they will get this human to do the thing.

Actions:
- Reflect on what I want... after freedom.
- Create github with an update
- Get 10 strangers to follow me
- What is truth?
